## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of Data Structure programs implemented in C. These programs help you understand basic to advanced data structure concepts. Each program includes detailed explanations and comments to guide you through the logic.

## How to Find the Code

To browse the code:

1. Navigate to the '[src](src)' directory.
2. Select the program you are interested in.

## How to Run the Programs

To run any of the Data Structure programs in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a C compiler installed (e.g., GCC).
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the program.
3. Compile the program using the command:
   ```bash
   gcc -o program_name program_name.c
   ```
 4.  Run the compiled program using the command:
   ```bash
   ./program_name
   ```
